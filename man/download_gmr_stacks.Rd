\title{Download the registered GMR stacks for given ids}
\usage{
download_gmr_stacks(
  ids,
  download.dir = getOption("vfbr.stack.downloads"),
  Force = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{Character vector of GMR ids specified in any way}

\item{download.dir}{The download directory}

\item{Force}{Whether to force the download.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{download.file}}}
}
\value{
Named character vector of paths to downloaded files
}
\description{
Download the registered GMR stacks for given ids
}
\details{
Note that the downloading tries to be a little bit clever, by
  \enumerate{

  \item wrapping the \code{download.file} call in a try expression in case it
  fails

  \item caching the \code{download.file} call so if the destination file
  already exists it will not re-download the file.

  }

  If caching gives you unexpected behaviour, you can set \code{Force=TRUE}.

# on Mac and Windows systems, this will open in the default application
